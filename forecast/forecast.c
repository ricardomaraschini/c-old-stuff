/**
 * while dealing with forecasting a behaviour that presents a trend,

 *
 * the gap between the point and the line is known as `error' and we
 * have to try to minimize it at most.
 *
 * technically speaking we have to assure a low `error sum of squares',
 * that is represented by:
 *
 *  âˆ‘eÂ²
 * (sum all squares of all errors, aka gaps)
 *
 * error on a given point can be noted as:
 *
 * et = yt - a - bt
 *
 * a and b are to be determined. putting the two formulas together we
 * have:
 *
 * âˆ‘eÂ² = âˆ‘(yt - a - bt)Â²
 *
 * on this formula, a represents the slop and b represents the y axis
 * value on t = 0;
